Hi, I'm Pontus.

I work as a game programmer at [River End Games](https://riverendgames.com).
Previously I worked at [Sleep Cycle](https://sleepcycle.com).

In my spare time I like to make music.
Check out my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/epoksound) if you want to listen to some of my stuff.
Check out my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/epok_modular/) if you want to see my music gear.

My old legacy blog is still available at https://pontusm.wordpress.com.

## History
I am a programmer of many things for the past 35+ years.
- In the 1980s I made my first games in Basic for the Commodore 64
- In the 1990s I made demos for Amiga and PC using assembly and C++
- In the 2000s I made mostly web server stuff and applications in C# and .NET
- In the 2010s I made games and apps for iOS in Objective-C and Swift
- Now, in the 2020s I am making games in C++ and Unreal Engine

I sometimes join game jams and make games for fun.
